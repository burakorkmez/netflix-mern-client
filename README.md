# Netflix Clone

> A Netflix clone that created with React.js

In this project I've used [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to fetch movies/series. It fetches all movies and series then categories them by their genres. Users can upload profile pictures and it is stored in firebase. Users itself is stored in MongoDB because when I first built this project my intension was to make it a MERN stack. For authentication I used JWT. Also some cool effects are available such as infinite scrolling effect(fetches more movies while scrolling).

## Built With

- React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
